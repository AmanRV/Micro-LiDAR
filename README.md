# Micro-LiDAR Spatial Mapping System

This project is a compact 3D embedded spatial mapping system, utilizing an ARM Cortex-M4F Microcontroller and a VLX53L1X Time-of-Flight sensor. It generates detailed spatial maps of indoor environments, offering a comprehensive 360-degree view with a range of up to 4 meters.
## 3D Scan and Location
